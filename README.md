# Hey, folks! 👋

I'm Salvatore Viganò, a coding enthusiast and lifelong learner. Currently pursuing my dreams of becoming a software developer, specializing in cybersercurity, at the University of Study of Palermo, Italy! 🇮🇹

I am passionate about creating amazing code and constantly challenging myself to learn new things. My current focus is on Informatics Engineering and I'm loving every second of it!

**Fun Facts About Me:**
- 🧙‍♂️ Hobbies: Coding (obviously!), cooking up a storm in the kitchen, and exploring the great outdoors.
- 🤖 Skills: Proficient in Python, Java, JavaScript, C, C++, and R. You could say I'm a multi-linguist... in programming languages.
- 🚀 Goals: I dream of building software that makes a positive impact on people's lives, like an app that automatically finds lost socks. Revolutionary, I know.

Remember, coding is like cooking - sometimes you follow a recipe, and sometimes you just throw in a little bit of everything and hope for the best. Here's to always having fun while coding! 🎉
